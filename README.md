### Top Down Shooter *OLD VERSION* :older_woman:

A top down shooter frame work made in Godot. The game has one player and one enemy for the player to shoot and defeat. This code base is considered outdated
and not really good for copying if you want to create your own top down shooter. *HOWEVER*, it does have a pretty interesting system for easily creating new
gun types. While this system is partially in the refactor code, I still use this project as a basic reference for some of the shooting physics. 

I would not recommend copying this out right, but just looking at it as a very terrible reference.

## How to Run :running:
This project only works on Godot 3.1.2.stable. Any newer version seems to crash due to a way I handle a static method.

1. Open up the project in Godot
2. Under the *FileSystem*, open up *Debug_Playbox.tscn*.
3. Press the *F6* key.

Congrats! You are now playing the game!

## WARNING :loudspeaker:
The sound of the shooting is very loud. If you are wearing headphones, please turn the volume down!

by that tutorial as well.
